        "Neurons are the fundamental processing units in the brain and they transmit signals in the form of short electrical pulses called action potentials (or spikes) that can be measured across the cell membrane. The membrane voltage of a neuron changes in time due to the flow of ions into or out of the cell, and this is governed by certain mechanisms. If this voltage reaches a threshold, then an action potential is generated and transmitted to other neurons. A great deal is known about the biophysical mechanisms that drive this neuronal activity, and this provides a basis for developing models that describe the dynamics of the membrane potential, ranging from simplified descriptions to highly detailed systems that account for more fine-grained variations in space and time.\n",

        "*Figure 1: **A** Structure of a neuron with schematic of the action potential. Generally speaking, the dendrites collect signals from other neurons and transmit them to the soma, which is the central processing unit of the cell. If the total input arriving at the soma exceeds a certain threshold, then an output signal is generated, which then travels along the axon and is delivered to other neurons. This is the fundamental form of communication between neurons. **B** Membrane potential dynamics of a single neuron. The voltage fluctuates due to the flow of ions across the membrane and the spike is generated if this voltage reaches a certain threshold.*\n",

        "\n",
        "In this lab, we will look at two simple models of the dynamics of the membrane potential which describe how the voltage evolves in response to changes in the external input (e.g. currents injected from other neurons) or to changes in the properties of the cell (e.g. time-dependent conductances). The material of this lab was mostly covered in lecture 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the absence of inputs, a certain voltage (the 'resting potential') is maintained across the membrane at which no net current will flow. The model of *passive membrane dynamics* describes how the potential varies if an external input is provided to the cell. Understanding this process is critical to understanding how neurons compute, given that neurons communicate by injecting current into each other via synapses.\n",
        "\n",
        "The passive model approximates all conductances in the membrane, which are related to how permeable the membrane is to ions, to be constant in time. However, this is not always a reasonable approximation and this model fails to capture some important properties, including how action potentials are generated. In fact, permeability of ion channels can be time- or voltage-dependent: as the membrane potential changes in time, so do the properties of the cell that contribute to its dynamics. The model for *active membrane dynamics* takes this into consideration and it describes how the membrane potential evolves in time when the conductances also vary. We will see how, contrary to the passive model, accounting for these variations in conductances can explain the mechanisms of generating action potentials."

You should also create an array of size $\\left[N_t+1, 1\\right]$ to store the values of the membrane potential $V$ in time (note that after $N_t$ iterations you will have $N_t+1$ time points).

        "If we have indeed derived the Nernst equation from lectures, we must have $\\frac{kT}{ze} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\implies k=eR/F$. This is indeed the case - physicists usually work with the Boltzmann factor $k$, but chemists prefer to work with the universal gas constant $R$ and Faraday constant $F$, and you will find both forms of the Nernst equation depending on the source. Note that we also have a minus sign - this is because we have measured voltage out $V_{out} - V_{in}$, while biologists measure it as $V_{in}-V_{out}$."
